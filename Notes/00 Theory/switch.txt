		Switch is Control Statement Used in C.
		Variable name Given as an expression in
		switch can be only of int or char Datatype.
		
		i.e. switch only supports expressions of
		int & char datatype.
		
		We cant write any condition as an expression,
		Also we can't write any Condition as value of 
		corresponding Cases in switch.
		
		while writing cases for our switch we should 
		provide value for our expression.
		
		If expressions datatype is int then values at case 
		can be written without single quotes.
		But if expressions datatype is char then values at 
		case should be written with single quote.
